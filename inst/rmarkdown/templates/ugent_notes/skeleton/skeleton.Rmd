# This is the actual title

Here you can write your notes.

## This is a section

All RMarkdown tricks work with this template. You can add exercises like this:


```{block, type="exercise"}
\item This is question 1
\item THis is question 2
\hlitem `\hlitem` allows you to highlight a question.
\extra
\item Here's another question
```

With the command `\fullwidth` you can include a paragraph in between 
the questions. In this template this command is used in the preamble.

Keep in mind you can change the name of the exercises using

```
header-includes: \exercisename{Exercises}
```
in the preamble.
