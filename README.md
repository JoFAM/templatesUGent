# the package templatesUGent

This repository essentially contains rmarkdown templates that can be used for
rendering PDFs. It implements (parts of) the house style of UGent, and includes
logos. It is heavily based on the way the [`rticles`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles) package is organised.

The code in the repository is licensed using GPL v3, and the code for the templates can be used under that license.

**The UGent logos are copyright protected and are not included in the GPL license. They can only be used if you have a direct link to Ghent University! Please check the file LICENSE.md for more information.**
